# Random Pokemon Generator

Submitted by: Krishnanshu Sharma

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Summary

Random Pokemon Generator is an android app that uses the Pokemon API to randomly generate a list of multiple pokemons in a RecyclerView. Upon clicking the 'Get' button a pokemon with their name, type and experience level are retrieved from the API and displayed on the app. This is a revised version and this one is a little reorganised and has some more stylistic elements.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üß†üòçüëæ
